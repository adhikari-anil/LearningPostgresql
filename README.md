## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations along with the concepts of table relationships and joins in PostgreSQL using the `pg` library as the PostgreSQL client in Node.js. Additionally, NeonDB is used for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Basic operations to create, read, update, and delete records in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Table Relationships:** Demonstrates the relationships between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
- **Joins:** Utilizes SQL joins to fetch related data across multiple tables.
- **NeonDB Integration:** Provides a GUI for easy management and visualization of the database.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- NeonDB account
